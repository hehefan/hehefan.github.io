    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a ZJU100 Young Professor with the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University. 
        Before that, I was a Research Fellow with Prof. Mohan S. Kankanhalli at National University of Singapore. 
        My research focuses on deep learning, computer vision, multimedia and AI for science, 
        with an emphasis on video (including point cloud video) analysis, unsupervised learning, vision-language applications and protein analysis. 
        I received my Ph.D. degree at University of Technology Sydney, advised by Prof. Yi Yang. 

    </p>
    
    <p>
        I am looking for highly motivated PhD students with exceptional coding ability and research experience. 
        Please drop me an email if you're interested.
